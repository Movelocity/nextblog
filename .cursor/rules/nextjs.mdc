Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; CSS is a second choice.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- No frontend component should execute a single fetch, all api fetching should be done at services, and make easy to use functions for components to use.
- Use classnames library for conditional classes.
- Do not use middleware in nextjs, implement wrappers instead.
- Use only react-icons for icons.
